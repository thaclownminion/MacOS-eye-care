# MacOS eye care app
This is an app that is meant to make you look away from your screen so your eyes live a little longer!
---
# How to download
To download this app just download the .zip file from the newest release and unzip it by double clicking on the .zip file. 
After you unzipped the file double click the "eyecare.app" you should get a pop-up that says thay you have to move the app to the trash. 
To still be able to run it go to:

**Settings -> Privacy & security** and scroll all the way down and click the "open anyways" button, then it should open the app.

## Disclaimer
I do not yet have a windows nor linux version and I'm working on it at the moment. 

## Plus
This app works on both intel and M/ARM chip based macbooks. 

## Where to find the app
You can find the app on the top of your screen (in the menu bar). 

# Features
- Focus time: You can set a focus time and in that time you won't be blocked. For example in a meeting. you can change your time in the settings. 
- Take break now: You can also take an early break by pressing the "Take break now" button
- Focus time cooldown: this is a feature that you have to turn on yourself in the settings but it sets a cooldown of a few minutes before you can enable the focus time again this prevents you from spamming the focus mode and not taking a break.
- Schedule: You can set days for when you do not want to get blocked. You can set those days in the settings, if this feature is not enabled it blocks every day.
- Break intervalls: You change the break interfalls in the settings, this is the amount of time between after a break has ended and when your next break starts.
- Notifications: You can enable notifications for 1, 2 and 5 minutes before your upcomming break starts. I do recomend the in-app notifications because these have a count down after your 1 minute notification and they don't stack up in your notification  center. You can also disable notifications
- Quitting: You will only be able to quit the app in the app settings. (settings than the Advanced tab where you have the quit button). 
- Cooldown before quittng: This feature adds a cooldown before you can press the quit button. This feature can be turned off.
